Local Root CA and auto-renewed HTTPS certificates for private networks and services<br>
with automatic deployment to Pi-hole, Technitium, and Tailscale
</p>

`local-https` creates a local Root CA and issues a server certificate for your machine, so you can access web UIs over HTTPS without browser warnings (after trusting the Root CA on your devices).

It can automatically deploy certificates and reload supported services:
- ✅ **Pi-hole** (FTL webserver or Lighttpd)
- ✅ **Technitium DNS** (uses a password-protected `.pfx`)
- ✅ **Tailscale** (adds your Tailscale DNS name to the certificate SANs)

-----

It is officially supported on Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, Armbian). Other Linux distributions may work but are not officially supported.

## 🚀 One-Step Automated Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luizbizzio/local-https/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

That installs the command to:

- `/usr/local/sbin/local-https`

Then it runs the setup flow (`local-https --install`) and offers auto-renew (systemd timer recommended).

-----

## ✨ What it does

- 🔐 Creates (or reuses) a **local Root CA** (`rootCA.crt`)
- 🪪 Issues a **server certificate** (default: **40 days**) with SANs for:
  - hostname
  - relevant LAN IPs (filtered)
  - `pi.hole` when Pi-hole is detected
  - Tailscale DNS name when available
- 📦 Generates:
  - `server.pem` (cert + key, for services like Pi-hole)
  - `server.pfx` (password-protected, for services like Technitium)
- 🔁 Can enable **automatic renewal** via **systemd timer** (or cron fallback)
- 🧠 On renewal, it only “deploys/restarts” if a new cert was actually created (unless forced)

-----

## 🧭 Usage

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo local-https --install` | Full setup (Root CA, server cert, PEM/PFX, permissions, auto-renew, optional Pi-hole deploy, Technitium TLS if detected) |
| `sudo local-https --renew` | Renew if needed (near expiry window). If nothing to do, exits fast |
| `sudo local-https --renew --force-renew` | Forces a new server certificate + rebuilds PFX + restarts detected services |
| `sudo local-https --status` | Shows current status and last run info |
| `sudo local-https --check` | Exit code indicates if renewal is needed |
| `sudo local-https --configure` | Re-run deploy steps for Pi-hole / Technitium without reinstalling everything |
| `sudo local-https --print-ca` | Prints `rootCA.crt` (useful to copy to devices) |
| `sudo local-https --print-pfx-pass` | Prints the PFX password (stored in a root-only file) |
| `sudo local-https --rotate-pfx-pass` | Rotates PFX password, rebuilds PFX, updates Technitium TLS settings |
| `sudo local-https --uninstall [--yes] [--purge-certs]` | Removes installed files and optionally deletes generated certs |

-----

## 🔁 Auto-renew (how it works)

- 📅 The server certificate is issued for **40 days**.
- ⏳ `--renew` only renews when the cert is close to expiry (default window: **7 days**).
- 🧩 If you enable systemd timer, it runs daily (with randomized delay).

Check the timer:

```bash
systemctl list-timers | grep local-https
systemctl status local-https-renew.timer --no-pager
```

See logs:

```bash
journalctl -u local-https-renew.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

Force-run via systemd (without editing unit files):

```bash
sudo systemd-run --unit=local-https-renew-force --service-type=oneshot   /usr/local/sbin/local-https --renew --force-renew
```

## 🧩 Service support

### 🟦 Pi-hole

- Detects Pi-hole automatically.
- Supports:
  - **FTL webserver TLS** (Pi-hole 6+)
  - **Lighttpd TLS** (older setups)
- On renew (when a new cert is created), it restarts the correct service so the new cert is used.

### 🟩 Technitium DNS

- If Technitium is detected, the script can configure Technitium Web UI TLS to use:
  - `server.pfx` + the stored password
- On renew (when a new cert is created), it restarts the Technitium service so the new cert is loaded.

### 🟪 Tailscale

- If `tailscale` and `jq` are available, the script adds your Tailscale DNS name (like `host.ts.net`) to the certificate SANs.

-----

## 📦 Files created

Default folder:

- `/etc/ssl/servercerts`

Main files:

- `rootCA.crt` and `rootCA.key` (local Root CA)
- `server.crt`, `server.key`, `server.pem`
- `server.pfx` and `.pfx-pass` (password file)

State:

- `/var/lib/local-https/state.env`

-----

## 📱💻 Install the Root CA on your devices

You must trust `rootCA.crt` on your device to avoid HTTPS warnings.

Get the certificate from the server:

- Print in terminal: `sudo local-https --print-ca`
- Or copy the file: `/etc/ssl/servercerts/rootCA.crt`

### 🪟 Windows

1. Copy `rootCA.crt` to your PC.
2. Double-click it → **Install Certificate**
3. Choose **Local Machine**
4. Put it in **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
5. Reopen the browser.

### 🍏 macOS

1. Open **Keychain Access**
2. Drag `rootCA.crt` into **System** keychain
3. Open the cert → set **Trust** to **Always Trust**

### 📱 iOS / iPadOS

1. AirDrop/email the `rootCA.crt` to the device, open it
2. Settings → **General** → **VPN & Device Management** → install profile
3. Settings → **General** → **About** → **Certificate Trust Settings** → enable full trust

### 🤖 Android

1. Copy `rootCA.crt` to the phone
2. Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → **Install a certificate** → **CA certificate**
3. Note: some apps ignore user-installed CAs.

### 🐧 Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo cp rootCA.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/local-https-rootCA.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

-----

### Why 40-day certificates

Public TLS Certificate Authorities and browser policies now favor shorter lifetimes (around 40–45 days) for security reasons. Our default 40-day validity matches this industry trend and avoids issues with browser trust and automated renewals. See SSL.com’s discussion on ~47-day certificates:
https://www.ssl.com/article/preparing-for-47-day-ssl-tls-certificates/

-----

## 📝 Notes

- 🧱 This is a **local CA**. It is for your own network and devices, not public HTTPS.
- 🧪 If you are testing renew: use `sudo local-https --renew --force-renew` and confirm the new `notAfter` date with OpenSSL.
- 🔧 Pi-hole Lighttpd mode may install `lighttpd-mod-openssl` via `apt-get`.
- 🐳 Not intended for container-based TLS termination or Docker ingress setups.
- 🧷 The PFX password is stored in a root-only file. Treat it as a secret.
